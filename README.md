# 1. Background
\
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
\
6 participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways and the data was recorded by accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
\

# 2. Objective
\
The main objective of this project is to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise.
